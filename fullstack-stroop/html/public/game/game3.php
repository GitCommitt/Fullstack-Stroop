Using brutal melee combat, heavy weapons, and fast-paced combo attacks, players smash their way through waves of enemies in classic side-scrolling action inspired by old-school arcade brawlers. As the journey continues, players explore frozen mountains, burning villages, and ancient ruins while unlocking new abilities, powerful weapons, and rage-based special attacks. The game combines intense hand-to-hand combat with a gritty Viking atmosphere, challenging players to prove their strength, honor, and dominance on the battlefield.',
